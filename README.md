Robin
---------

An [Automated Liquid Handling machine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_handling_robot) from the biomed industry, Robin is being modified into some form of 3D printer.  Robin is sometimes refered to as "that big blue thing in the corner".

Robin has industrial-grade stepper drivers and linear stages. In comparison to our 3d printers we regularly build the machine's precision and ease of use blows them out of the water. The documentation is very extensive but very helpful. The important things that are consulted often have been screenshotted.

This project is currently being led and mostly worked on by Scott Pidzarko. Feel free to get involved or ask him questions. 

The machine currently can move it's x,y, and z axis from Prontrface or any other software that works with the Marlin firmware. Endstops are in the process of being wired: if you understand well how opto-endstops work please feel free to explain them to Scott - he would love to save time and avoid headaches.
