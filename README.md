Robin
---------

An [Automated Liquid Handling machine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_handling_robot) from the biomed industry, Robin is being modified into some form of 3D printer.  Robin is sometimes refered to as "that big blue thing in the corner".


This isn't really my project, so someone with a better idea of what is going on with Robin should probably update this. -Rowan
